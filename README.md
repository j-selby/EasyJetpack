InfinityJetpacks
===========

Based on the [EasyJetpack](http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/easyjetpack/) plugin by j_selby

Fly around with jetpacks, rocket boots, and put a nether star to use with this plugin! Java 8 is required for this plugin to work.

The current version is 1.7 Beta 2. Use it at your own risk, as they may not be "stable."

Release builds can be found in the release page for this project. Thanks to Paul Vogel for making this plugin compatible with Minecraft 1.9.4.

AntiCheatReloaded is recommended for use of this plugin, as it will prevent problems associated with this jetpack. Such problems include being teleported to the ground while in flight. The plugin can be found [here](https://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/anticheatreloaded/).
